#Project1: Smile Bank
---

##Project Description
>This project is a modified version of the Revature Online Banking App.

Within my implementation, credit cards and account freezing features are not implemented as per the modified design requirements.

##Usage
Currently a user cannot effectively deploy the backend part of the application if they do not have a database model which is equal to the one I designed and utilized in the project.

The only HTML pages a user can currently explore will be the unauthenticated pages.
